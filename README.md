# Supervised Machine Learning

Welcome to the meticulously curated repository housing an extensive array of resources and in-depth notes from the inaugural course, [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression & Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction#outcomes) part of the esteemed [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) offered by DeepLearning.Ai in collaboration with Stanford University. 

This repository serves as a professional reservoir, offering a comprehensive understanding of the foundational principles of machine learning. Delivered by the distinguished AI visionary, [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/), whose illustrious career includes pivotal research leadership at Stanford University, as well as groundbreaking contributions to the field at Google Brain, Baidu, and Landing.Ai.
